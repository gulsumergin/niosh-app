NIOSH-RWL-CALCULATOR
BAHÇEŞEHİR UNIVERSITY Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences Dept. Industrial Engineering – Dept. Software Engineering
COMPUTERIZED NIOSH RECOMMENDED WEIGHT LIMIT (C-NIOSH-RWL) SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS Purpose:

NIOSH RWL is a quantitative method for ergonomically analyzing and improving manual lifting tasks. The objective of this project is to develop a software (web-based or mobile) for application of NIOSH RWL method. The software will be used in the INE2012 work study and ergonomics classes for educational purposes.
Functional Requirements: C-NIOSH-RWL MUST:

allow user to enter task parameters
visually show parameters of the task (e.g. what H means for horizontal multiplier)
calculate multiplier values
calculate RWL value
calculate Load Index (LI) value
interpret LI value and give the risk level for the task
propose ergonomic improvements
generate a report to include all the information above.
Non - Functional Requirements: C-NIOSH-RWL MUST:

offer good UX and be developed in line with UX principles
be educational and provide info about task parameters, RWL, LI, and risk levels
allow giving an ID to the analysis (e.g. task id number, task name, brief task description)
give a report that is easy to print and save (e.g. PDF format)
